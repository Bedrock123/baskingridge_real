Homescreen
1. Food Type: How it should work?
    - Bascially this is just going to be a drop down or selection that allows the user to pick what kind of food they prefer. 
    - For the restaurant owner this would be a similar drop down that gives them the option of saying what kind of food they provide.
2. Verification Screen: Could we do a call? We didn’t understand the simulation
    - This is for the Business ID of the restaurant signing up for the service. The client wants to ensure that when they sign up that they are actual business. 
    - This business ID would cross reference with an existing public database to ensure they are real businesses.
3. What is the difference between the restaurant photos in the first step and the last one? (Sign Up Flow)
    - None. It is redudan.t
4. How we should fill “Special for the day”?
    - This is a quick on the spot menu option that allows them to quickly add the main special of the day. This might be an already existing menu item or a new one that they add with a timed shutdown.
Menu Builder
1. Parent Menu should have a price?
    - No, only the food items and the side options will have prices.
2. Can you explain me the menu template?
    - This is going to be selected from a list of differant templates they can choose from.
    - It is like choosing a skin for a menu and a general theme of the layout
Dashboard
1. Upload wait time + progress time? (Not following)
    - This is a on-the-spot form field where the restaurant can indicate what is their current wait time for food orders.
2. How it should work the Cooking Portal?
    - There will most likely be a printer that they will have in the back that will show all of the new orders. This will not be a UI/UX screen.
3. Live View? 
    - This indicates all of the current Dine & Dash users in the restaurant at that time or just entering at that time.
Order Dispute
1. Let’s talk about this flow as well.
    - Both parties have this dispute page. It is basically just a private chat that the customer can then open up another chat with a Dine & Dash employee if they feel the restaurant will not resolve the issue.
